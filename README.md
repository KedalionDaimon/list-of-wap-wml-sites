# LIST OF WAP WML SITES
List of WAP WML sites (started on 2025-01-11)

COLLECTION OF ENGLISH-LANGUAGE WAP SITES

compiled by Nino Ivanov, 11th January 2025

Introduction

WAP as a technology has been, by now, since the 1999 launch of commercial sites, longer dead than alive. Testing such functionality has become harder due to the very absence of any sites to visit. This compilation shall serve the purpose to suggest the traveller remote lands where he can still stear his Nokia and Siemens ships towards. Presented are "better" sites and "worse" sites, according to my own, personal discretion with no claim of objectivity. Automatically generated sites have been ignored. Included sites must be at least partially in English.
